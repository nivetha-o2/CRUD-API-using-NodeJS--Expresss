#  Building CRUD API with Node.js and Express

This project demonstrates a simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) API built using Node.js and Express. The API follows REST architecture principles and is designed to handle basic CRUD operations for a sample resource.

## Project Overview

The purpose of this project is to provide a foundational understanding of how to create and manage a RESTful API using Node.js and Express. The API allows clients to perform CRUD operations on a sample resource. This project also includes examples of how to test the API using Postman.

## Features

- Create a new resource
- Read existing resources
- Update an existing resource
- Delete a resource

## Technologies Used

- **JavaScript**: The programming language used for the server-side logic.
- **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime used for building the API.
- **Express**: A Node.js framework used to create the API endpoints and handle routing.
- **Postman**: A tool used for testing the API endpoints.
